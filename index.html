<h2> Eric Gaydu</h2> 
<p>
  The lion is looking intently at his prey.   He is 
  assessing the energy of it and whether he can easily
  capture it or it needs a little more effort.

  Once he determines this bit of info, he can then properly
  proceed on his next action.
</p>  
<p>
  His prey at first seems oblivious to the lion.   But she 
  jerks her head quickly in the lion's direction and realizes
  that her situation is dire.   She starts to dart off as the 
  lion begins to make his chase.  She runs around in zig-zag formation trying to shake off the 
  lion.  </p>
  <p>
  The lion inches closer to his prize but just when he's 
  about to make a pounce, the prey makes an unexpected scramble
  in a different direction.    That gives her just enough time to
  further herself away from the impending danger.

  The lion roars in defeat knowing he'll have to seek other prey.
